## How to install

Install as a global pi package from npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@leblancfg/pi-fusion
```

Or install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/leblancfg/pi-fusion
```

Open pi and turn it on from the settings pane:

```text
/fusion
```

**pi-fusion adds a planning fanout to pi.** Before the normal pi turn starts, it runs an
(optional) discovery agent, rewrites variations of the prompt into complementary angles, fans out to
planner workers, consolidates their proposals via intermediate integrators, then injects the integrated
plans back into the main thread, that acts as a synthesis step.

Combining independent model responses has been shown to outscore the individual frontier models on
many benchmarks. Because independent passes behave differently, the synthesis model can reuse the
useful disagreement instead of betting everything on one path through the problem.

In some cases, you can get better performance than frontier models with better price and latency.

N.B. OpenRouter has a hosted Fusion router (`openrouter/fusion`) that runs a multi-model panel and
judge behind one API route. pi-fusion is similar. It runs local pi subprocesses against your working
tree, and hands their notes to the synthesis model you already chose. You control all configuration of
how this happens, including whether the planning subprocesses get all tools or only read-only tools.

## Why this exists

Coding agents often make the first plausible plan they see. That is fine for chores. It gets
sketchier when a task has hidden coupling. `pi-fusion` makes multiple model calls at inference time,
merged back into one synthesized response. Other words in the litterature mention compound inference
systems, inference-time scaling, test-time compute, model panels, multi-agent deliberation, and
Mixture-of-Agents.

Not all reasoning has to happen as one long serial chain inside the most
expensive model. Some of it can run in parallel across slightly cheaper or dumber models, then get
compressed into a single final turn.

OpenAI's [o1 write-up](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) made the
test-time-compute axis feel obvious: give a model more thinking budget, and it can do better. The
next step in that direction is to ask the question: what if some of that budget is more calls, more
samples, or more agents instead of one longer hidden chain?

A few useful breadcrumbs:

- Berkeley BAIR's
  ["The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems"](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/)
  defines compound AI systems as systems that use multiple interacting components: model calls,
  retrievers, tools, or control logic.
- Chen et al., ["Are More LLM Calls All You Need?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02419), studies
  scaling laws for compound inference systems that aggregate multiple LM calls.
- Snell et al., ["Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314),
  frames inference-time compute as its own scaling axis.
- Brown et al., ["Large Language Monkeys"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787), shows repeated
  sampling can amplify weaker models, sometimes cost-effectively.
- Wang et al., ["Mixture-of-Agents"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04692), shows multiple LLM agents
  can improve final answer quality when their outputs are aggregated.

My own evals point in the same direction for a subset of coding tasks: parallel planner calls can be
cheaper, faster wall-clock, and better than sending everything straight to the biggest model. Not
always. The whole point of this repo is to make that claim easy to test instead of treating it like
a vibes-based architectural diagram.

## What you see

In TUI mode, a fused turn shows a live pane:

1. **Discovery** loads shared context once.
2. **Workers** appear as vertical splits, each with its own prompt angle.
3. **Synthesis** starts after the planning bundle is ready.

Useful controls:

```text
/fusion   open settings
Esc       cancel the fanout and fall back to a normal turn
1-9       focus one worker column
0 / Tab   return to split view
p         show or hide rewritten worker prompts
```

And a little one-character status bar that marks whether the next turn is armed or not.

## When to use it

Good fit:

- "Find the bug, but I am not sure where it lives."
- "Plan this refactor before touching files."
- "Review this unfamiliar area and suggest the smallest safe change."
- "Compare a few implementation paths before we commit to one."

Bad fit:

- Tiny edits where startup latency costs more than the task.
- Prompts with images. The synthesis turn can see them; discovery and workers currently cannot.
- Fully non-interactive runs where you need progress output on stdout. `pi-fusion` stays quiet there
  so it does not corrupt print/JSON output.

## Configure it

Open the settings pane:

```text
/fusion
```

| Row            | What it changes                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Next turn      | Arms fusion for the next eligible user prompt, then turns off. |
| Presets        | Saves the current pane settings, loads saved ones, or deletes. |
| Workers        | Sets worker count and opens per-worker model settings.         |
| Agent tools    | Switches discovery/workers between all tools and read-only.    |
| Discovery      | Picks the context-loading model and reasoning effort.          |
| Rewrite        | Toggles prompt rewriting before worker fanout.                 |
| Integrators    | Toggles intermediate integrators, model, and reasoning effort. |
| Synthesis      | Picks the synthesis model and reasoning effort.                |
| Save and close | Persists settings in the pi session.                           |

Presets are user-defined snapshots of the settings pane. There are no built-in
profiles, because those would go stale and hide assumptions. Save your own from
`/fusion` → **Presets**. Global presets live in `~/.pi/agent/fusion.yml`;
project presets live in `.pi/fusion.yml` and override global presets with the
same name. Existing `fusion.json` files still load. See [docs/presets.md](docs/presets.md)
for the full format and examples.

### Assigning models and reasoning effort to panes

You can assign different models and reasoning effort levels to each stage (pane) in the pipeline:

- **Discovery pane:** Set model via `/fusion discovery-model SPEC` or `--fusion-discovery-model SPEC`. Set reasoning effort via `/fusion discovery-thinking LEVEL`.
- **Worker pane:**
  - Set default worker model via `/fusion worker-model SPEC` or `--fusion-worker-model SPEC`.
  - Set per-worker models via the `/fusion` UI → **Workers** → **configure ▸**. In the per-worker pane, you can assign individual models and reasoning levels to worker `#1`, `#2`, etc.
- **Integrator pane:** Set model via `/fusion integrator-model SPEC` or `--fusion-integrator-model SPEC`. Set reasoning effort via `/fusion integrator-thinking LEVEL`.
- **Synthesis turn:** Set model via `/fusion synthesis-model SPEC` or `--fusion-synthesis-model SPEC`. Set reasoning effort via `/fusion synthesis-thinking LEVEL`.

The status bar uses a compact union marker: `∪̸` means fusion is off, and `∪` means the next eligible
turn is armed.

For local development, load the TypeScript entrypoint directly:

```bash
pi -e ./extensions/pi-fusion/index.ts
```

The published package uses the `pi.extensions` field in `package.json`; there is no separate `index.json` manifest.

CLI flags exist for repeatable starts:

```bash
pi --fusion-workers 4 \
  --fusion-discovery-model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 \
  --fusion-worker-model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 \
  --fusion-synthesis-model openai/gpt-5.2-codex
```

Use `current` or omit a model flag to keep the main session model. Reasoning values are:

```text
current, off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh
```

## Prompt Customization

You can fully customize all the prompts used by `pi-fusion`. On first run, default prompts are automatically written to your global `fusion.yml` file (`~/.pi/agent/fusion.yml`). You can see and edit them there, or override them on a per-project basis. Existing `fusion.json` files remain supported.

### Where prompts are stored

`pi-fusion` reads prompts from two locations:

| Scope   | Path                     | Use it for                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Global  | `~/.pi/agent/fusion.yml` | Default templates used across all projects.         |
| Project | `.pi/fusion.yml`         | Project-specific templates to share with your team. |

Project-level prompts override global prompts per field. pi-fusion searches upward from the current working directory for an existing `.pi/fusion.yml`, `.pi/fusion.yaml`, `.pi/fusion.json`, or `.git` directory, so launching pi from a subdirectory still finds repo-level config. For example, a project file can override only `worker` while keeping your global `discovery`, `rewrite`, and `synthesis` templates.

### YAML format

Add a `prompts` section at the top level of your `fusion.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1
prompts:
  discovery: |
    ...
  rewrite: |
    ...
  worker: |
    ...
  synthesis: |
    ...
presets:
  cheap-planners:
    description: Fast worker fanout, current model as synthesis
    settings:
      workerCount: 3
```

### Available Prompts & Placeholders

Each prompt supports simple `{{placeholder}}` templating. You can rearrange, rewrite, or completely re-format the instruction text, as long as you preserve the template tags you want to substitute.

#### 1. Discovery Prompt (`prompts.discovery`)

This prompt guides the discovery agent to explore your codebase.

- **Placeholders:**
  - `{{cwd}}`: Working directory of your project.
  - `{{task}}`: Your original prompt.
  - `{{recentContext}}`: Pre-formatted recent conversation history.
  - `{{toolGuidance}}`: Pre-formatted guidance for the selected planner tool mode.

#### 2. Prompt Rewrite (`prompts.rewrite`)

This prompt is used to ask the rewrite model to generate worker prompts.

- **Placeholders:**
  - `{{workerCount}}`: The number of parallel workers.
  - `{{task}}`: Your original prompt.
  - `{{recentContext}}`: Pre-formatted recent conversation history.

#### 3. Worker Prompt (`prompts.worker`)

This prompt runs on each parallel worker.

- **Placeholders:**
  - `{{cwd}}`: Working directory of your project.
  - `{{task}}`: Your original prompt.
  - `{{assignedPrompt}}`: The rewritten prompt variation generated for this worker.
  - `{{discoveryContext}}`: Context loaded and handed off by the discovery agent.
  - `{{workerName}}`: Slot index/name (e.g. `#1`, `#2`).
  - `{{discoveryGuidance}}`: Pre-formatted guidance on how to use the discovery context.
  - `{{toolGuidance}}`: Pre-formatted guidance for the selected planner tool mode.
  - `{{recentContext}}`: Pre-formatted recent conversation history.

#### 4. Integrator Prompt (`prompts.integrator`)

This prompt runs on each intermediate integrator consolidating worker proposals.

- **Placeholders:**
  - `{{cwd}}`: Working directory of your project.
  - `{{task}}`: Your original prompt.
  - `{{integratorName}}`: Integrator index/name (e.g. `Integrator #1`, `Integrator #2`).
  - `{{discoveryContext}}`: Context loaded and handed off by the discovery agent.
  - `{{workerOutputs}}`: Formatted worker outputs/plans to be evaluated and consolidated.
  - `{{recentContext}}`: Pre-formatted recent conversation history.

#### 5. Synthesis Prompt (`prompts.synthesis`)

This prompt formats the final planning bundle injected into the synthesis turn.

- **Placeholders:**
  - `{{task}}`: Your original prompt.
  - `{{discoveryContext}}`: Context loaded by the discovery agent.
  - `{{variations}}`: List of worker prompt variations.
  - `{{plannerOutputs}}`: Integrated plans produced by intermediate integrators (or workers if integrators are disabled).
  - `{{imageNote}}`: A note telling the synthesis step that workers did not see attached images (if any).

> 💡 **Important:** The synthesis prompt template should contain `<!-- pi-fusion:synthesis-prompt -->` so that subsequent conversation turns know a fused turn has finished and bypass fusion automatically. If a custom synthesis prompt omits it, pi-fusion prepends the marker defensively.

pi --fusion-resume-bytes 8000
pi --fusion-timeout-ms 600000
```

Fusion is off by default. Use `--fusion-enabled` to start with the next eligible turn armed;
`--fusion-disabled` forces it off. After a fused turn starts, `pi-fusion` automatically disarms
itself. `--fusion-model` remains as a backwards-compatible alias for `--fusion-worker-model`. Use
`--fusion-preset NAME` to load a preset from `~/.pi/agent/fusion.yml` or `.pi/fusion.yml` at
startup. Planner subprocesses get all tools by default; use `/fusion tools read-only` or
`--fusion-planner-tools read-only` to restore the original narrow read/search/list tool set.

## What gets sent where

When fusion is armed, the next idle, non-command user input consumes that arm and:

- opens a live discovery pane in TUI mode;
- runs query rewriting in parallel with discovery;
- replaces discovery with live worker splits after discovery finishes;
- starts standalone `pi` subprocesses in JSON print mode;
- keeps your other extensions enabled in those subprocesses; only pi-fusion itself opts out (via the `PI_FUSION_SUBAGENT` env var) so workers can use your installed extensions without recursive fusion;
- gives discovery and workers either all normal tools (default) or only read/search/list tools (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`);
- gives query rewriting no tools;
- injects shared discovery context into every worker prompt;
- asks workers for concise planning markdown;
- inserts the final planning bundle into the synthesis turn's system prompt via `before_agent_start`.

The user's message stays untouched in the session. `/tree` and `/fork` still show the original
prompt, and the planning bundle does not accumulate across turns. Fusion then returns to off
automatically, so the following prompt runs normally unless you arm it again.

## Session archive & resume

Everything happens inside a single pi session file, so a fused turn stays auditable and resumable —
which matters for production and long-running workloads.

Each fused turn writes two things into the session tree:

- **A full archive.** The complete, untruncated discovery, rewrite, and worker transcripts are saved
  as `pi-fusion-archive` `custom` entries (chunked only for storage, never semantically truncated).
  pi's context builder never feeds `custom` entries to the model, so the archive is full-fidelity
  without ever inflating the context window. Each run gets a sortable `run-id`.
- **A bounded handoff.** A single `custom_message` carries a budgeted summary of the worker
  conclusions plus a pointer to the archive `run-id`. This is the only fusion content that resumed
  and subsequent turns actually see, capped by `fusion-resume-bytes` (default `8000`).

The result: when you resume a session, the model gets a useful, compact handoff instead of the raw
sub-agent dumps, but the full transcripts are still on disk for audit, display, or export. Inspect
them any time with `/fusion-transcript` (optionally `--write <path>` to export). Because the archive
lives in `custom` entries, it survives resume but is filtered out of normal `/tree` conversation
flow.

The synthesis turn itself still sees a larger slice of worker output (`fusion-output-bytes`); only
the durable, in-context handoff is clamped by `fusion-resume-bytes`.

## Bypasses

Fusion is skipped for:

- slash commands and prompt templates (`/...`);
- user bash (`!...`);
- extension-injected input;
- steering or follow-up messages queued while the agent is running;
- prompts that are already fusion synthesis prompts;
- any turn where fusion is off/disarmed.

These skips keep the extension predictable and avoid recursion.

## Context budget

Worker output inserted into the synthesis turn is capped per worker (`fusion-output-bytes`, default
`12000`). Recent conversation context sent to discovery and workers is capped separately
(`fusion-context-bytes`, default `16000`). Discovery tool-result context is bounded before being
shared downstream.

Three byte budgets keep the three audiences separate:

- `fusion-output-bytes` (default `12000`) — worker output inserted into the synthesis turn's prompt.
- `fusion-resume-bytes` (default `8000`) — worker conclusions kept in context for resumed and
  subsequent turns (the durable handoff).
- `fusion-context-bytes` (default `16000`) — recent conversation sent down to discovery and workers.

Full worker transcripts are stored in the session file as non-context archive entries (see
[Session archive & resume](#session-archive--resume)). They are recoverable via `/fusion-transcript`
but never enter the context window automatically.

## Rough edges

- Discovery, rewrite, and worker planning block the turn until the fanout finishes, times out, or
  you cancel with `Esc`.
- Discovery and workers are subprocesses, not true pi session forks. They receive a truncated text
  snapshot of recent conversation. Their full output is archived into the parent session afterward
  rather than as live sub-sessions.
- Discovery and workers do not see attached images.
- Worker subprocesses load normal pi context files such as `AGENTS.md` and your installed extensions; only pi-fusion stays inert inside them (gated by `PI_FUSION_SUBAGENT`).
- The live split pane only appears in TUI mode. Print, JSON, and RPC modes still run fusion without
  that UI.
- Print, JSON, and RPC modes intentionally get no progress output. stdout is the consumed payload in
  those modes.
- Malformed `fusion.yml`, `fusion.yaml`, or `fusion.json` files are ignored instead of crashing the extension; fix the config syntax if presets or prompts are missing unexpectedly.
- Some providers hide reasoning streams, so a worker column may show no reasoning even with
  reasoning enabled.
- Discovery and worker tool access defaults to all tools. Use read-only planner tools for safer planning passes when you do not want subprocesses to run write-capable tools.
- The current pipeline uses two LLM round trips before the synthesis turn. A lighter mode may exist
  later, but the explicit flow is better for testing right now.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run check
```

Useful narrower checks:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run smoke
```
